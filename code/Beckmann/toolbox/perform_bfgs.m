%   Full call: [x, R, f, d, H, iter, info, X, G, w, fevalrec, xrec, Hrec] = bfgs(pars,options)
%   Input parameters
%    pars is a required struct, with two required fields
%      pars.nvar: the number of variables
%      pars.fgname: string giving the name of function (in single quotes)
%         that returns the function and its gradient at a given input x,
%         with call   [f,g] = fgtest(x,pars)  if pars.fgname is 'fgtest'.
%         Any data required to compute the function and gradient may be
%         encoded in other fields of pars.
%    options is an optional struct, with no required fields
%      options.x0: each column is a starting vector of variables
%          (default: empty)
%      options.nstart: number of starting vectors, generated randomly
%          if needed to augment those specified in options.x0
%          (default: 10 if options.x0 is not specified)
%      options.maxit: max number of iterations
%          (default 1000) (applies to each starting vector)
%      options.nvec: 0 for full BFGS matrix update, otherwise specifies
%           number of vectors to save and use in the limited memory updates
%          (default: 0 if pars.nvar <= 100, otherwise 10)
%      options.H0:
%          for full BFGS: initial inverse Hessian approximation
%           (must be positive definite, but this is not checked)
%          for limited memory BFGS: same, but applied every iteration
%           (must be sparse in this case)
%          (default: identity matrix, sparse in limited memory case)
%      options.scale:
%          for full BFGS: 1 to scale H0 at first iteration, 0 otherwise
%          for limited memory BFGS: 1 to scale H0 every time, 0 otherwise
%          (default: 1)
%      options.ngrad: number of gradients willing to save and use in
%           solving QP to check optimality tolerance on smallest vector in
%           their convex hull; see also next two options
%          (default: min(100, 2*pars.nvar, pars.nvar + 10)
%          (1 is recommended if and only if f is known to be smooth)
%      options.normtol: termination tolerance on d: smallest vector in
%           convex hull of up to options.ngrad gradients
%          (default: 1e-6)
%      options.evaldist: the gradients used in the termination test
%           qualify only if they are evaluated at points  approximately
%           within distance options.evaldist of x
%          (default: 1e-4)
%      options.fvalquit: quit if f drops below this value
%          (default: -inf)
%      options.xnormquit: quit if norm(x) exceeds this value
%          (default: inf)
%      options.cpumax: quit if cpu time in secs exceeds this
%          (default: inf) (applies to total running time)
%      options.strongwolfe: 0 for weak Wolfe line search (default)
%                           1 for strong Wolfe line search
%          (strong Wolfe line search is not recommended for use with
%           BFGS; it is very complicated and bad if f is nonsmooth;
%           however, it can be useful to simulate an exact line search)
%      options.wolfe1: first Wolfe line search parameter
%          (ensuring sufficient decrease in function value, default: 0)
%          (should be > 0 in theory, but 0 is fine in practice)
%      options.wolfe2: second Wolfe line search parameter
%          (ensuring algebraic increase (weak) or absolute decrease (strong)
%           in projected gradient, default: 0.5)
%          (important in theory and practice that this is not 0 or 1,
%           except that it can be set to 0 if an exact line search is to be
%           simulated, using options.strongwolfe = 1)
%      options.quitLSfail: 1 if quit when line search fails, 0 otherwise
%          (default: 1, except if options.strongwolfe = 1 and
%           options.wolfe2 = 0, simulating exact line search)
%          (0 is potentially useful if f is not numerically continuous)
%      options.prtlevel: one of 0 (no printing), 1 (minimal), 2 (verbose)
%          (default: 1)
%
%   Output parameters:
%    all return information on the runs for each starting vector
%    x: the final iterates
%    f: the final function values
%    d: the final smallest vectors in the convex hull of the saved gradients
%     at termination (the final gradient if options.ngrad == 1)
%    H: final BFGS inverse Hessian approximation matrices
%     (full BFGS update only, symmetrized so they are exactly symmetric)
%     (nan if limited memory updates were used)
%    iter: number of iterations
%    info: reason for termination:
%     0: tolerance on smallest vector in convex hull of saved gradients met
%     1: max number of iterations reached
%     2: f reached target value
%     3: norm(x) exceeded limit
%     4: cpu time exceeded limit
%     5: f is inf or nan at initial point
%     6: direction not a descent direction due to rounding error
%     7: line search bracketed minimizer but Wolfe conditions not satisfied
%     8: line search did not bracket minimizer: f may be unbounded below
%    X: iterates where saved gradients were evaluated (see below)
%    G: saved gradients used for computation of smallest vector in convex hull
%      of gradients at points near final x
%    w: weights giving the smallest vector in the convex hull of the saved
%      gradients
%    fevalrec: record of all function values evaluated in all line searches,
%      including the final accepted values (nans if options.strongwolfe = 1)
%    xrec: record of all x iterates
%    Hrec: record of all H iterates
%     (not symmetrized, may not be symmetric because of rounding error)
%    Note: if there is more than one starting vector, then:
%      f, iter, info are vectors of length options.nstart
%      x, d are matrices of size pars.nvar by options.nstart
%      H, X, G, w, xrec, Hrec are cell arrays of length options.nstart, and
%      fevalrec is a cell array of cell arrays
%    Thus, for example, d(:,i) = G{i}*w{i}, for i = 1,...,options.nstart
%
%   BFGS is normally used for optimizing smooth, not necessarily convex,
%   functions, for which the convergence rate is generically superlinear.
%   But it also works very well for functions that are nonsmooth at their
%   minimizers, typically with a linear convergence rate and a final
%   inverse Hessian approximation that is very ill conditioned, as long
%   as a weak Wolfe line search is used. This version of BFGS will work
%   well both for smooth and nonsmooth functions and has a stopping
%   criterion that applies for both cases, described above.
%   See A.S. Lewis and M.L. Overton, Nonsmooth Optimization via BFGS, 2008.

% The weak Wolfe line search is far less complicated that the standard
% strong Wolfe line search that is discussed in many texts. It appears
% to have no disadvantages compared to strong Wolfe when used with
% Newton or BFGS methods on smooth functions, and it is essential for
% the application of BFGS or bundle to nonsmooth functions as done in HANSO.
% However, it is NOT recommended for use with conjugate gradient methods,
% which require a strong Wolfe line search for convergence guarantees.
% Weak Wolfe requires two conditions to be satisfied: sufficient decrease
% in the objective, and sufficient increase in the directional derivative
% (not reduction in its absolute value, as required by strong Wolfe).
%
% There are some subtleties for nonsmooth functions.  In the typical case
% that the directional derivative changes sign somewhere along d, it is
% no problem to satisfy the 2nd condition, but descent may not be possible
% if the change of sign takes place even when the step is tiny. In this
% case it is important to return the gradient corresponding to the positive
% directional derivative even though descent was not obtained. On the other
% hand, for some nonsmooth functions the function decrease is steady
% along the line until at some point it jumps to infinity, because an
% implicit constraint is violated.  In this case, the first condition is
% satisfied but the second is not. All cases are covered by returning
% the end points of an interval [alpha, beta] and returning the function
% value at alpha, but the gradients at both alpha and beta.
%
% The assertion that [alpha,beta] brackets a point satisfying the
% weak Wolfe conditions depends on an assumption that the function
% f(x + td) is a continuous and piecewise continuously differentiable
% function of t, and that in the unlikely event that f is evaluated at
% a point of discontinuity of the derivative, g'*d, where g is the
% computed gradient, is either the left or right derivative at the point
% of discontinuity, or something in between these two values.
%
% For functions that are known to be nonsmooth, setting the second Wolfe
% parameter to zero makes sense, especially for a bundle method, and for
% the Shor R-algorithm, for which it is essential.  However, it's not
% a good idea for BFGS, as for smooth functions this may prevent superlinear
% convergence, and it can even make trouble for BFGS on, e.g.,
% f(x) = x_1^2 + eps |x_2|, when eps is small.
%
% Line search quits immediately if f drops below fvalquit.
