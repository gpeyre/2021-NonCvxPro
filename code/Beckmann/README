This directory contains the code to reproduce the experiment on the Beckmann Wasserstein-1 problem.

It compares three algorithms:
- Noncvx-Pro (non-convex variable projection)
- Douglas-Rachford
- Primal-Dual

The two main scripts are:
- Demo_BeckmannGraph.m: test on a 3D mesh (default: 20K vertex cortex) with finite element Laplacian.
- Demo_BeckmannMesh.m: test on a graph (default: K-NN graph on baker's yeast genomic expression) with the graph Laplacian.
